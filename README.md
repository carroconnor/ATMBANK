# ATMBANK
One of the smaller projects I completed while at Eleven Fifty was this console application built in C# made to simulate the expierence
of someone using an ATM.  I appreciate this project becuase it was one of my first introductions into taking in data, manipulating the
data, storing the data, and spitting the data back out to the user.  

## Getting Started

If you would like to take a closer look at this application you will be able clone the project from 
https://github.com/carroconnor/ATMBANK/new/master using git clone within a command prompt and then open it up within visual studio on
your machine.  I made a quick video to further display the application. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRs58bEhLq0&feature=youtu.be

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio

### Installing

Open up the Bank app within visual studio.

Run the application.

Use the account info that is already within the database.

When the application asks you for an Account Number you should type in 12345678.

When the application asks you for a Pin you should type in 1234.

The application will then give you a few options to choose from such as Check Balance, Deposit, and Withdrawl.
Choose the option you want to proceed with by pressing the corresponding number.

After a user makes a deposit or withdrawl the application will display the new account balance to the user.

## Deployment

If you would like to deploy this further I encourage a user to use Azure or AppHarbor
